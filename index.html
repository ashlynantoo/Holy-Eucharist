        <h1>Holy Mass/ Holy Eucharist</h1>
        <p>
          Holy Mass did not come out of thin air but has roots in the Word of
          God. In Exodus 19, God called Israelites to establish a covenant with
          him, making them His chosen people. As preparation, they had to
          sanctify themselves. Then the Lord came down on Mount Sinai and then
          came the Word of God, the ten commandments (Exodus 20). All Israelites
          answered with one voice that they would do everything the Lord had
          told them. Then they offered sacrifice and burnt offerings to the
          Lord. Moses then took the blood of the sacrifice and splashed it on
          the altar as well as the people saying that it is the blood of the
          covenant which the Lord has made with them. Then Moses went up with
          Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy elders of Israel and they saw God and
          then they ate and drank (Exodus 24).
        </p>
        <p>
          In Israel's history, this kind of ritual gathering of God's people
          could be seen with the same elements: God calling his people together,
          their sanctification, proclamation of the Word of God, prayer and
          praise to God, and the sacrificial offering.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Holy Mass, we can see the same structure: God calls us
          together, we repent our sins, give praises to God, the proclamation of
          the Word of God, and the holy sacrifice (Jesus himself) in which we
          partake.
        </p>
        <p>
          God had chosen bread and wine as the material for the Holy Eucharist
          well before. In Psalms 110: 4, David prophesied that the Lord has
          sworn to Jesus that "You are a priest forever in the manner of
          Melchizedek". Melchizedek was the king of Salem and the priest of God
          Most High who offered sacrifice in the form of bread and wine.
          (Genesis 14:18).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Old Testament, three aspects set the stage for the Holy
          Eucharist: Manna, Bread of the Presence, and Passover.
        </p>

        <h2>Manna</h2>
        <p>
          While in the wilderness, when the whole Israel community grumbled
          against Moses and Aron regarding food, the Lord rained down bread from
          heaven, Manna in the morning, and quail in the evening twilight every
          day (except Sabbath) for forty years until the Israelites entered the
          promised land (Exodus 16). As per Lord's command, they kept some of
          the Manna in a jar in the Ark of the Covenant so that future
          generations could see the food the Lord gave them to eat in the
          wilderness. This Ark of the Covenant was kept in the Tabernacle.
        </p>

        <p class="attribute">
          <em>Gathering of Manna - An early renaissance art, 15th century</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Manna was not only miraculous but also holy, so it was kept in the
          Holy of Holies within the tabernacle (Hebrews 9: 4). The Holy
          Eucharist is also kept in the tabernacle so that we may see and adore
          Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Manna tasted like wafers made with honey. Manna was the foretaste of
          the promised land, a land flowing with milk and honey. Similarly, Holy
          Eucharist is the foretaste of heaven (heavenly banquet). Just as Manna
          was provided as nourishment for Israelites on their journey from Egypt
          to the promised land, God is providing us Holy Eucharist for our
          nourishment during our journey from earth to heaven.
        </p>

        <h2>Bread of the Presence/ Showbread</h2>
        <p>
          In Exodus 25, God gave instructions to Moses on how to build the
          Tabernacle. Hebrews 9: 2-4 explains that the Tabernacle had the Holy
          Place as well as the Holy of Holies. The Ark of the Covenant and the
          gold altar of incense were placed in the Holy of Holies. Menorah (the
          lampstand), the table, and the Showbread/ Bread of the Presence were
          in the Holy Place.
        </p>
        <p>
          The table was covered with gold and had rings fastened to it so that
          it could be carried with poles. This indicates that it shouldn't be
          touched. On the table, the Bread of the Presence was always kept
          before the Lord. The table also had plates and cups as well as
          pitchers and bowls - all made of pure gold - for pouring libations
          (drink offering usually wine poured out upon the altar as a part of a
          sacrificial ceremony).
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          In Leviticus 24: 5-9, the Lord instructed Moses to place 12 loaves of
          bread in two piles (six in each pile) on the table and on each sabbath
          day, to set out the bread before the Lord on behalf of the Israelites
          by an everlasting covenant. When the old bread was replaced by the new
          bread on each sabbath, the old one was consumed by the priests. Since
          it was sacred, only priests could eat it in a sacred place. Some pure
          frankincense was also put with each pile of bread as an oblation
          (sacrificial offering) to the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bread was always set before the Lord. It was a perpetual offering,
          a sign of God's continuing presence among his people. Also, Leviticus
          24: 1-4 specifies that the lamps set up on the menorah must be burned
          regularly before the Lord. In Numbers 4: 7-8, when the table was taken
          out of the tabernacle, the table, as well as the bread, were covered
          with cloth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since only priests could enter the Holy Place, the table and bread of
          the Presence were hidden from the common people. Three times a year
          (feasts of Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles), when the Israelites
          made their pilgrimage to Jerusalem Temple, they were shown the table
          and the bread of the Presence. The priests would take and elevate the
          Showbread proclaiming "Behold, God's love for you!"
        </p>
        <p>
          The Hebrew word translated as 'presence' is also translated as 'face'
          in the Old Testament. Hence Bread of the Presence can also be called
          Bread of the Face (of God).
        </p>
        <p>
          In Exodus 24, Moses with Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy elders of
          Israel went up the Mount Sinai and participated in a heavenly banquet
          in which they saw God and ate and drank. Bread of the Presence was a
          kind of memorial of that heavenly banquet. The tabernacle was the
          visible sign of the invisible heavenly place of God that Moses saw on
          Mount Sinai and Bread of the Presence was the visible sign of the
          invisible Face of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          To conclude, the Bread of the Presence was sacred and was an unbloody
          sacrifice offered to God on behalf of the people, a meal for the
          priests, a sign of the covenant between God and His people, a sign of
          God's continuing presence among His people and a sign of God's love
          for His people.
        </p>

        <h2>Passover</h2>
        <p>
          Passover was not just a meal but also a sacrifice. The Passover was
          and is on the 14th day of the month of Nisan (the first month of the
          Jewish calendar) followed by 7 days feast of unleavened bread
          beginning on Nisan 15th. The instructions that were given in Exodus
          12: 1-20 directed the Israelites to observe the Passover at their
          home. On the 10th of Nisan, every family must procure for itself a
          one-year-old unblemished male lamb. They must keep it until the 14th
          and then it would be slaughtered during the evening twilight. Then
          they must take some of its blood and apply it to the house’s two
          doorposts and lintel and consume its meat that same night, eating it
          roasted with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. When the Lord struck
          down every firstborn in the land and executed judgment on all the gods
          of Egypt, the blood saved the Israelites from the destructive blow.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Exodus 12: 25, Moses instructed the Israelites to observe this rite
          when they enter the promised land. In Deuteronomy 16: 5-7, Moses gave
          instructions to Israelites to observe the Passover only at the place
          the Lord would choose as the dwelling place of His name. After the
          Jerusalem temple was built, the Passover lambs were sacrificed in the
          temple, and the Passover meal was to be eaten within the city of
          Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 30: 1, 14-21 and 2 Chronicles 35:1-19
          indicates that kings Hezekiah and Josiah celebrated Passover in
          Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Jewish belief was and is that while observing the Passover, they
          are participating in that historical event. i.e., even though it
          happened thousands of years ago, they are personally present at that
          event. Jewish rabbi Gamaliel, mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles
          wrote "Every man in every generation must consider himself as having
          been personally delivered from Egypt. Every Israelite must know that
          he personally has been freed from slavery."
        </p>
        <p>
          In his <em>Wars of the Jews</em>, Flavius Josephus records that in 4
          BC, over 250,000 lambs were sacrificed for Passover. The lambs were
          sacrificed in the temple on the evening of Nisan 14 within a two-hour
          time slot (from the ninth to the eleventh hour, or 3:00-5:00 pm). The
          Jews called the Passover ceremony and the feast of unleavened bread as
          the feast of Passover. A Jewish day begins not at midnight, but at
          sunset (6 PM to 6 PM).
        </p>

        <h3>Passover sacrifice</h3>
        <p>
          On the 10th of Nisan, a one-year-old unblemished male lamb was chosen
          for the Passover by a member of the household. The lamb would be
          examined to make sure that it was without blemish. Before Passover,
          the entire house would be cleaned to remove all the leaven. On the
          evening of Nisan 14 between 3 PM and 5 PM, the Passover lamb would be
          sacrificed at the temple.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Passover lambs were sacrificed in three groups in the courtyard of
          the Jerusalem temple. The slaughter could be performed by a layman,
          but the rituals dealing with the blood and fat were to be carried out
          by a priest. A priest would collect the blood from the lamb in gold or
          silver cups and would pass the cup to the rows of priests who stood in
          line from the Temple court to the altar, where the blood was
          sprinkled. The lamb was then hung up on special hooks or sticks with
          forearms spread in crucifixion pose and skinned. Then the abdomen was
          cut open, and the fatty portions intended for the altar were taken
          out, placed in a vessel, salted, and offered by the priest on the
          altar, while the remaining entrails were taken out and cleaned. While
          the lambs were sacrificed, Levites recited the Hallel (Psalms
          113-118).
        </p>

        <h3>Passover meal</h3>
        <p>
          The Passover meal was to be eaten within the city of Jerusalem. The
          sacrificed lambs were then roasted. No bones might be broken either
          during cooking or eating. The lamb was set on the table at the evening
          banquet. The sacrifice had to be consumed entirely that same evening,
          nothing was allowed to remain overnight. Every participant had to take
          a piece of lamb at least as large as an olive.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the time of Jesus, the Passover meal had a well-established order
          with specific rules and regulations, steps, and stages. The Passover
          meal was preceded by several hours of fasting beginning at 3:00 PM at
          the time of the Passover sacrifice. The meal would begin just before
          nightfall, with the head of the family gathering his household to
          recline at a large table.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the guests and family members entered the home to celebrate
          Passover, their feet would be washed by a servant or slave. All the
          members would wash their hands before the Passover meal and the table
          would be set with food and wine. The Passover meal was structured
          around 4 cups of wine. The head of the family blessed each cup praying
          "Blessed are you, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who has
          created the fruit of the vine..." and the four verbs of Exodus 6: 6-7
          were recited, one over each cup.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first cup (cup of sanctification) was poured, blessed and the verb
          "I am the LORD. I will free you from the burdens of the Egyptians."
          was recited. The first cup was then drunk. Then they would have bitter
          herbs with vinegar/ salt water.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then the second cup (cup of deliverance/ plagues/ judgment) was poured
          but not drunk. After this, all the food and wine were removed from the
          table. It was at this time the head of the family explained the story
          of Exodus to the younger ones, what God has done for Israel. Then all
          the food and wine were returned to the table. The significance of the
          Passover lamb, unleavened bread, and bitter herbs was then explained,
          and Psalms 113-114 were recited. The second cup was blessed and the
          verb "I will deliver you from their slavery." was recited and then
          drunk. The hand washing was done for the second time out of respect
          for the unleavened bread to be eaten. After this, the roasted Passover
          lamb with vegetables and one unleavened bread was served and prayers
          over the bread "Blessed are you, O Lord our God, King of the universe,
          who brings forth bread from the earth..." was said. The bread was then
          broken and dipped in bitter herbs and eaten along with lamb.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third cup (cup of redemption/ blessing) was then poured. The
          second unleavened bread was blessed, broken, and eaten. The third cup
          was blessed and the verb "I will redeem you by my outstretched arm and
          with mighty acts of judgment." was recited and drunk.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fourth cup (cup of praise/ hope/ kingdom/ salvation/ restoration)
          was then poured, and Psalms 115-118 were recited. After that, the last
          cup was blessed, the verb "I will take you as my own people, and I
          will be your God; and you will know that I, the LORD, am your God who
          has freed you from the burdens of the Egyptians." was recited and then
          drunk. This completed the Passover meal.
        </p>

        <h2>Jesus as the Passover lamb</h2>
        <p>
          Jews believed that the ultimate redemption through the Messiah would
          occur at the Passover. Their picture of Messiah was a political savior
          who will lead Israel out of the bondage of the nations. Jesus made his
          entry into Jerusalem on the 10th of Nisan presenting himself as the
          unblemished Passover lamb to be sacrificed. The people misunderstood
          Jesus as the political savior and they greeted Him with palm branches
          and hailed Him as King, shouting "Hosanna," which means "save us." By
          their acclamations, it was clear that they chose Jesus as their
          savior. Unwittingly, the people chose Jesus as their Passover lamb on
          the day the lambs were to be chosen.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lamb chosen for Passover must be checked for blemishes. The chosen
          lamb should be perfect, spotless, and unblemished. In the Gospels
          (Matthew Ch. 21 & 22, Mark Ch. 11 & 12, Luke Ch. 20), when Jesus was
          teaching at the temple, the chief priests, Pharisees, Sadducees, and
          elders of the people were asking difficult questions, trying to trap
          Him in His words. Essentially, they were looking for any blemish which
          might disqualify him as Messiah. Jesus answered each question soundly,
          and no one was able to find fault in him which proves that He is
          without blemish.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before Passover and the feast of unleavened bread begins, all leaven
          must be cast out of the homes of the Israelites. Every nook and corner
          of the house was cleaned, and every trace of leaven was removed. It
          was during these days that Jesus entered the Jerusalem temple and
          drove out all who were buying and selling in the temple and overturned
          the tables of money changers and seats of those who sold doves. In
          doing so, Jesus kept the command of cleansing the home by cleansing
          his Father's house.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the beginning of Nisan 14, Jesus and his disciples celebrated the
          Passover in the upper room. At Calvary, Jesus was stripped of his
          garments, hung on the cross and his blood was shed on the altar, the
          holy cross. Jesus died on the cross at 3:00 PM on the 14th of Nisan,
          the same time when the sacrifice of the Passover lambs began at the
          Jerusalem temple and the Levites began their chanting of Hallel. As
          they chanted, " I was caught by the cords of death (Psalms 116: 3),
          Dear in the eyes of the LORD is the death of his devoted (Psalms 116:
          15), The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone
          (Psalms 118: 22), our Paschal lamb, Christ was sacrificed (1 Cor 5:
          7). By his blood, we are saved from the wrath (Rom 5: 9).
        </p>
        <p>
          Psalms 34: 21 prophesied that none of Jesus’s bones would be broken.
          It was customary during crucifixion to break the leg bones of the
          person after a few hours to hasten their death. The only way a person
          could breathe while hanging on a cross was to push up with his legs.
          By breaking the legs, death was followed soon by asphyxiation.
          However, in the case of Jesus, even though they broke the legs of the
          other two men, they did not break His legs since He was already dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the 16th of Nisan (the feast of first fruits), the Israelites would
          take some of the grain, the "first fruits" of their harvest to the
          Temple to offer it to the Lord as thanksgiving. In 1 Cor 15: 20, Paul
          refers to Jesus Christ who has been raised from the dead, as the first
          fruits of those who have fallen asleep. Hence Jesus is the fulfillment
          of God's promise of the resurrection of those who follow the Messiah.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the reason why John the Baptist testified "Behold, the Lamb of
          God, who takes away the sin of the world." (John 1: 29)

        <h2>The Last Supper and the Crucifixion</h2>
        <p>
          At the last supper, Jesus celebrated the Passover meal. But he
          transformed it into an event that commemorates the New Covenant. In
          Luke 22: 7-13, Jesus sent out Peter and John to do preparations for
          the Passover. Jesus did not reveal the location of the upper room to
          His disciples because He didn't want Judas to know the location
          earlier. He didn’t want to get arrested before the institution of the
          Holy Eucharist. Jesus specified how much he desired to eat that
          Passover with His disciples in Lk 22:15.

        <p>
          The Last Supper happened at the beginning of Nisan 14. During the
          supper, Jesus washed the feet of His disciples (John 13: 4-5). In John
          13: 14, Jesus encouraged His disciples to wash one another's feet
          since He, their master and teacher, had done so. It symbolized what he
          would later do for His people as in Mark 10: 45 ("For the Son of Man
          did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a
          ransom for many.").
        </p>
        <p>
          Washing of feet was not just a symbol of love, charity, and humility,
          but also of the priestly ordination of the apostles. In Leviticus 8:
          6, Moses washed Aaron and his sons with water for their priestly
          ordination. When Peter didn't allow Jesus to wash his feet, Jesus
          answered him saying “Unless I wash you, you will have no
          <em>inheritance</em>
          with me.” (John 13: 8). In Numbers 18: 20, the Lord said to Aaron that
          "I (the Lord) will be your <em>portion</em> and your heritage among
          the Israelites." The same Greek word is used for both inheritance and
          portion in the bible indicating that the priest's inheritance is the
          Lord. Hence, by washing His disciples' feet, Jesus established the
          priesthood so that the priests could celebrate his holy sacrifice,
          which He asked the disciples to do "Do this in memory of me.” (Luke
          22: 19).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the details about the Last Supper in the Gospels (Matthew 26:
          26-30, Mark 14: 22-26, Luke 22: 14-20), it had some of the features of
          the Passover meal: blessing, and breaking of the unleavened bread,
          blessing, and distribution of cups of wine, and the chanting of
          Psalms. But there was one notable absence, the Passover lamb. Instead,
          Jesus offered himself as the Passover lamb to be consumed under the
          appearance of bread and wine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus himself said "This is my body" (Matthew 26: 26) while giving the
          bread and "This is my blood of the covenant, which will be shed on
          behalf of many for the forgiveness of sins." (Matthew 26: 28) while
          distributing wine to His disciples. Here Jesus is replacing the old
          covenant God made with His people at Mount Sinai with the New
          Covenant, and it is ratified with His blood. Just as Moses sprinkled
          the blood of the old covenant on the altar and the people, Jesus shed
          his blood on the altar, the holy cross, and is giving His blood for
          His people to drink. Hence, we can say that the consecrated wine is
          not just a symbol of Jesus's blood but His blood itself. Likewise, the
          consecrated bread is not just a symbol of His flesh, but His flesh
          itself. Like the Israelites who renewed the covenant with God (under
          Josiah, Ezra), each holy communion is a renewal of the new covenant
          with God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two cups of wine specified in Luke 22: 14-20 were the second and
          the third cup of the Passover meal. It is the third cup, the cup of
          blessing/ redemption Jesus said that it is His blood. This is what St.
          Paul said, "The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a
          participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it
          not a participation in the body of Christ?" (1 Corinthians 10: 16).
        </p>
        <p>
          After distributing the third cup, His blood to the disciples, Jesus
          said "Amen, I say to you, I shall not drink again the fruit of the
          vine until the day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God." (Mark
          14: 25). After that, they recited Psalms 115-118 and then went to
          Mount of Olives (Mark 14: 26). This means that Jesus didn't have the
          fourth cup of the Passover meal which indicates that Jesus didn't
          complete the Passover meal in the upper room. The explanation about
          the fourth cup is not formally or explicitly taught by Catholic Church
          but follows from the church’s teaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the garden of Gethsemane located at the base of the Mount of
          Olives, Jesus prayed three times "My Father, if it is possible, let
          this cup pass from me; yet, not as I will, but as you will." (Matthew
          26: 36-46). Here Jesus is referring to the fourth cup which he didn't
          have at the Passover meal in the upper room. At Calvary, before
          crucifying Jesus, they gave wine to Jesus to drink. But He refused to
          drink that wine (Matthew 27: 33-34) because his mission was not yet
          accomplished. But in John 19: 28-30, when Jesus became aware that
          everything was finished, He said "I thirst". Then they put a sponge
          soaked in wine on a sprig of hyssop and put it up to His mouth. When
          Jesus had taken the wine, he said, "It is finished" and bowing His
          head, He handed over the spirit. What is finished? The Last Supper.
          Jesus had his fourth cup (cup of praise/ hope/ kingdom/ salvation/
          restoration) on the cross just before His death. Thus, by delaying the
          fourth cup until he dies, Jesus united His passion and death to the
          Last Supper. Hence Jesus's passion and death became the Passover
          sacrifice, and the Last Supper became the Passover meal where the
          Passover lamb, Jesus is consumed.

          The Jews believe that while observing the Passover, they are
          participating in that historical event. i.e., even though it happened
          thousands of years ago, they are personally present at that event.
          Similarly, Holy Mass is not just a memorial of Christ's passion,
          death, and resurrection but we are participating personally in those
          events even though it happened two thousand years ago.
        </p>

        <h2>Bread of Life</h2>
        <p>
          In John chapter 6, it was around the feast of Passover, Jesus
          performed the sign of the multiplication of the loaves (John 6: 1-15).
          Here Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed them to those
          who followed Him. When everyone had their fill, His disciples
          collected the remaining fragments in twelve wicker baskets indicating
          that there was more than enough food to feed all the people who
          followed Him. When the people saw Jesus multiplying the loaves, they
          were reminded of Manna that the Lord provided when Moses called upon
          the Lord. The Jews were familiar with these words of Moses, "A prophet
          like me will the LORD, your God, raise up for you from among your own
          kindred; that is the one to whom you shall listen." (Deuteronomy 18:
          15). So, the people said to themselves "This is truly the Prophet, the
          one who is to come into the world." (John 6: 14).
        </p>
        <p>
          The same evening, Jesus performed the sign of walking on the water
          (John 6: 16-21). Here, Jesus was walking on the sea and when the
          disciples got afraid, He said "It is I. Do not be afraid." Also, the
          boat that the disciples were in immediately arrived at the shore.
          Seeing this, the disciples might be reminded of Moses who parted the
          red sea so that the people could walk over the dry land. But here
          Jesus, instead of parting the water, walked over the water and
          transported them immediately to the shore. Also, "I AM" is the word
          used by God when He revealed Himself to Moses. Hence, this sign shows
          Jesus's control over nature and His divinity.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the above two signs, Jesus did miracles on the bread as well as His
          body. The multiplication of the loaves prefigures the superabundance
          of the Holy Eucharist to all who follow Jesus. Thinking about walking
          on water, Jesus without any change in His external appearance did a
          miracle inside His body so that His body didn't sink while walking on
          the water (For nothing will be impossible for God - Luke 1: 37). Think
          about transubstantiation. Even though the consecrated bread and wine
          appear as bread and wine, the inner substance changes to the body and
          blood of Jesus Christ. The above two signs bear witnesses for the
          bread of life discourse.

        <p>
          The next day, while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum, Jesus said
          "I am the living bread that came down from heaven; whoever eats this
          bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh
          for the life of the world." (John 6: 51).
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people argue that in the above passage, Jesus used metaphor. They
          say that bread and wine are just symbols of His body and blood. But
          that is not right. Whenever Jesus used metaphors, He made sure that
          the audience understood them. Whenever they had a confusion, He
          clarified their doubt. For example, in John 3: 3-5, when Jesus said
          that no one can see the kingdom of God without being born again,
          Nicodemus got confused. Then Jesus clarified his confusion saying no
          one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and
          Spirit. Similarly, in Matthew 16: 5-12, when Jesus warned the
          disciples about the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees, they
          misunderstood that Jesus said so because they didn't bring bread with
          them. Then Jesus cleared their misunderstanding by saying that He
          didn't talk about the leaven of bread but about the leaven (teaching)
          of Pharisees and Sadducees.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus was not speaking metaphorically when He said that the bread is
          His flesh. Because when the Jews quarreled among themselves saying
          "How can this man give us [his] flesh to eat?" (John 6: 52), Jesus
          re-emphasized what he said using stronger words "Amen, amen, I say to
          you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood,
          you do not have life within you. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my
          blood has eternal life, and I will raise him on the last day. For my
          flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. Whoever eats my flesh
          and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him." (John 6: 53-56). In
          the above passage, instead of using the Greek word
          <em>phago</em> (eat), Jesus used a more intense word
          <em>trogo</em> (gnaw/ chew) to make them understand that he literally
          wanted them to eat His flesh and drink His blood. The word
          <em>trogo</em> is never used metaphorically in Greek.
        </p>
        <p>
          The people literally understood that Jesus was telling them to eat His
          flesh and drink His blood. Mosaic law forbids the drinking of blood.
          So many of His followers couldn't accept this teaching and they left
          him (John 6: 66). But Jesus didn't call them back. Instead, he asked
          the disciples whether they also would like to leave. If Jesus was
          speaking metaphorically, He would have clarified His teaching and
          wouldn't have allowed His followers to leave Him. But that didn't
          happen. Jesus didn't want to make any compromise in this teaching.

          To conclude, communion with the Body and Blood of Christ increases the
          communicant's union with the Lord, forgives his venial sins, and
          preserves him from grave sins. Since receiving this sacrament
          strengthens the bonds of charity between the communicant and Christ,
          it also reinforces the unity of the Church as the Mystical Body of
          Christ (CCC 1416). What we can do is attend the Holy Mass and consume
          His body and blood worthily as often as we can.
        </p>
        <p>
          “For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim
          the death of the Lord until he comes. Therefore whoever eats the bread
          or drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily will have to answer for the
          body and blood of the Lord. A person should examine himself, and so
          eat the bread and drink the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks
          without discerning the body, eats and drinks judgment on himself. That
          is why many among you are ill and infirm, and a considerable number
          are dying. If we discerned ourselves, we would not be under judgment;
          but since we are judged by [the] Lord, we are being disciplined so
          that we may not be condemned along with the world.” (1 Cor 11: 26-32)
